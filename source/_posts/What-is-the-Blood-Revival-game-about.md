#  How do I play the Blood Revival game?

The game is played on a square board with a grid of 9 squares by 9 squares. The player has 10 pieces, which are initially placed in the two bottom right-hand corners of the board.

The aim of the game is to capture all of the opponent’s pieces, or to block the opponent so that they cannot make any more moves.

Capturing a piece is done by jumping over it with one of your own pieces. If you can jump over an opponent’s piece and land on an unoccupied square, then you capture their piece. If there are multiple pieces that you could jump over, then you may choose which one to capture.

If you are unable to make a move, then your opponent can either move one of their pieces or give you back one of your pieces. You can also choose to forfeit the game if you do not want to play anymore.

# How do I win?

There are two ways to win the game: either capture all of the opponent’s pieces, or block them so that they cannot make any more moves.

#  Who developed the Blood Revival game?

The Blood Revival game was a collaborative effort between developers Evan Todd and Byron Atkinson. Atkinson is a software engineer and indie game developer, while Todd is an artist who has worked in the games industry for over 10 years. The two first met online in a Unity3D forum and quickly bonded over their common love of game development.

They initially attempted to develop a game together in 2012, but it was unsuccessful. They decided to try again in 2014 with Blood Revival, which was their first successful project.

The two continued to work together on other projects, including the mobile game Paws & Claws, until Atkinson’s death in 2017.

Since then, Todd has continued developing games under the EvanToddGames banner, most notably the upcoming first-person shooter, Outlander.
