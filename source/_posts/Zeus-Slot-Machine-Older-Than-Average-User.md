#  Slot Maker Zeus Turns 1000: How Old Is The Slot Machine?

Slot machines are a mainstay of casinos the world over. They are one of the most popular games to play, and they generate billions in revenue for casinos each year. But how old are slot machines?

The first slot machine was created by a man named Charles Fey in San Francisco in 1895. The machine was called the Liberty Bell, and it had three spinning reels with five symbols each. It was an instant hit, and other companies soon began to create their own machines.

Slot machines quickly spread throughout the United States, and they became a mainstay of casino gambling. In fact, many states only allowed gambling on slot machines, so casinos were forced to install them if they wanted to attract customers.

Today, slot machines are found in casinos all over the world. They continue to be one of the most popular games to play, and they continue to generate billions in revenue for casinos each year.
