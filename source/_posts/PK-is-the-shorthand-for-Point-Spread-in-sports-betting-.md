#  PK is the shorthand for Point Spread in sports betting 

A Point Spread, or "PK" for "Point Spread", is a type of wager used in sports betting in which a gambler bets on the margin of victory of one team over another. The most common use of a point spread is in American football and basketball, where it is used to create an equal playing field between two teams by giving the underdog team points.

For example, if the Indianapolis Colts are playing the Detroit Lions and the oddsmakers set the point spread at 7 points in favor of Indianapolis, then someone betting on Detroit would win their bet if Detroit either won the game outright or lost by 6 points or fewer. If Detroit were to lose by more than 7 points, then the person betting on Indianapolis would win their bet.

Point spreads are often expressed in half numbers, such as 2.5 or 3.5, to avoid tying up too much money on half-point bets. So if someone wanted to bet $10 on Detroit with a point spread of 2.5,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) they would risk $10 on Detroit either winning or losing by 2 points or less.

#  In PK, the favourite team is handicapped by giving away points, while the underdog starts with an advantage 

In sports, there is often a favourite team and an underdog. The favourite is handicapped by giving away points, while the underdog starts with an advantage. This is done in order to make the match more fair and exciting.

In Pakistan, cricket is the most popular sport. The national cricket team is the underdog against international teams, as they are not as experienced or well-funded. However, this makes for more exciting matches, as the Pakistani team has shown time and again that they can compete with the best in the world.

The Pakistani team is currently ranked 6th in the world. They have made it to the semi-finals of major tournaments such as the Cricket World Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy on multiple occasions. In fact, they reached the final of the ICC Champions Trophy in 2017 before losing to India.

One of the reasons for Pakistan’s success is their passionate fans. No other team in the world enjoys as much support from its fans as Pakistan does. This creates a formidable home ground advantage for them.

Pakistan’s biggest rivals are India and Sri Lanka. The matches between these teams are always heavily contested, and often go down to the wire. As a result, these matches are some of the most exciting to watch in all of cricket.
