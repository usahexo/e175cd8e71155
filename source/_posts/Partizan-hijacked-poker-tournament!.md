"I had just reached the final table when all of a sudden my screen went black," said one player. "When I came back, I saw that all my chips had been transferred to another player's account."

Another player, who had earlier made it to the final three players competing for first place, saw his chip count reduced from $600,000 to zero in a matter of minutes.

"It's like something out of a movie," he told reporters. "I still can't believe it actually happened."

#  What is the hijack in poker and how can you use it?

The hijack is the seat two positions to the left of the cutoff in a poker game. It is also the name of a specific starting hand. The hijack is important because it is usually one of the first hands to come off the draw, which means that players playing from this position will have more information than those playing from later positions.

Since the hijack is so close to the cutoff, it can be used as a way to get information on what kind of hands other players are holding.
