#  Manchester United FC Works Twice As Hard To Earn Victory

Manchester United FC played out a come-from-behind victory against AFC Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday.

 José Mourinho’s side fell behind to an early Junior Stanislas goal, but fought back to take all three points with second-half goals from Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic.

It was a hard-fought and well-deserved win for United, who worked twice as hard as their opponents to earn the victory.

Mourinho made five changes to the side that lost to Manchester City last week, with Ashley Young, Phil Jones, Marouane Fellaini, Marcus Rashford and Lukaku all coming into the starting lineup.

United started the match brightly and had a couple of chances in the opening 10 minutes, but it was Bournemouth who took the lead in the 13th minute. Stanislas was left unmarked inside the box and he shot past David de Gea to give the home side the lead.

United continued to create chances throughout the first half, but they couldn’t find a way through Bournemouth’s stubborn defence. The home side defended well and created a few chances of their own, but United went into halftime 0-1 down.

Mourinho made two changes at halftime, with Fellaini and Rashford replaced by Matic and Jesse Lingard. The change immediately paid off as United equalised in the 49th minute. Lukaku headed in Young’s cross to make it 1-1.

United then took control of the match and Matic scored his first goal for the club in the 81st minute. He volleyed in Lingard’s cross to give United a 2-1 lead.

Lukaku then made it 3-1 in stoppage time, firing in another header from Young’s cross to seal an impressive comeback victory for United.

#  Man Utd Doubles Its Efforts For Sixth Straight Win

Manchester United had an easy task in their latest Premier League game when they hosted bottom club, Huddersfield Town. The match marked David Wagner’s 100th game in charge of the Terriers and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s first as Manchester United manager.

The Norwegian made only one change to the team that beat Cardiff City last weekend, with Marcus Rashford coming in for Alexis Sanchez. It was a comfortable victory for the Red Devils, with goals from Rashford, Ander Herrera and Anthony Martial.

There was some concern for Manchester United early in the match when Paul Pogba was injured and had to be replaced by Scott McTominay. However, this didn’t seem to affect the home side too much as they continued to dominate possession and create chances.

Huddersfield Town’s best chance of the match came early on when Phil Billing forced a save from David de Gea. The Spaniard was also called into action later in the half to keep out a shot from Laurent Depoitre.

The hosts took the lead in the 23rd minute when Rashford finished off a well-worked team move. The goal was Rashford’s 50th for Manchester United in all competitions and he also became the youngest player ever to score in six consecutive Premier League matches.

Ander Herrera doubled Man Utd’s lead shortly before halftime with a low shot from outside the area. It was his first goal of the season and his first for Manchester United since January 2018.

The second half was pretty much one-way traffic as Manchester United looked to add to their lead. Martial finally got on the scoresheet in the 84th minute with a well-struck volley from just inside the area. It was his ninth goal of the season and his fourth in his last four appearances.

#  Red Devils Double Up For A Big Win

The Red Devils had a big home win against the Wombats this weekend, with a final score of 6-3.

It was an intense match from start to finish, as both teams fought hard for the victory. The early minutes were neck and neck, with neither team able to score a goal.

However, the Red Devils eventually pulled ahead in the 21st minute with a goal from striker Tom Davies. The Wombats managed to score one back before halftime, making the score 2-1 in favour of the Red Devils.

The second half was just as exciting as the first, with both teams scoring another two goals each. The final score was 6-3 in favour of the Red Devils, who are now in third place on the league table.

This was an important win for the team, as they continue their push for playoffs. They'll be looking to carry this momentum into their next match against the Blue Bears.

#  Manchester United Finds Second Wind, Wins Again

After a rocky start to their season, Manchester United have finally found their groove, and are now on a winning streak.

Their latest win came against Newcastle United, with a final score of 3-2. This was an especially important victory, as it puts them in 5th place in the Premier League table - just one spot behind Tottenham Hotspur.

The match wasn't easy though, as Newcastle led for most of the game. In the end, Manchester United's perseverance paid off, with goals from Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, and Jesse Lingard.

This latest win is a sign that Manchester United are back on track and ready to compete for the Premier League title. They'll need to continue to play at this high level if they want to catch up to front runners Liverpool and Manchester City.

#  Double Trouble: Manchester United Wins Again!

For the second time in a week, Manchester United comes out on top with a 2-1 victory against Southampton at Old Trafford. Goals from Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard sealed the win for Mourinho’s side who are now unbeaten in their last 16 Premier League games.

Lukaku opened the scoring with a well-placed header in the first half before Lingard doubled the advantage after the break with his eighth goal of the season. Southampton did pull one back through substitute Manolo Gabbiadini but it was not enough to prevent United from claiming all three points.

The result means that United move back up to second place, eight points behind leaders Manchester City, while Southampton stay in 13th position. It was also a good response from Mourinho’s side after they were knocked out of the League Cup by Championship side Bristol City earlier this week.

Lukaku has been in excellent form recently, scoring six goals in his last seven appearances for club and country, and he will be looking to continue this run when United travel to Everton on Sunday.
