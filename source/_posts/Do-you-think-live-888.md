# Do you think live 888?

888 is one of the most popular online casinos in the UK. They offer a wide variety of games, as well as some of the best bonuses and promotions in the business. But do they offer good enough odds to make it worth your while?

Before answering that question, let's take a look at some of the things you can expect from 888:

-A massive game selection, including slots, table games, and live casino games
-A generous bonus structure, with up to £888 available for new players
-Daily promotions and tournaments
-Fast and easy payouts

So how do the odds compare? In general, online casinos offer worse odds than traditional land-based casinos. But this isn't always the case, and 888 is one of those casinos that offers fairly good odds. In fact, their blackjack games offer some of the best odds in the business. So if blackjack is your game, 888 is definitely worth checking out.

Overall, 888 is a great choice for UK players. They offer excellent games and bonuses, as well as smooth and reliable gameplay. So if you're looking for a quality online casino experience, 888 is hard to beat.

# Do you think Denver Broncos?

It’s been a tough year for the Denver Broncos. After coming so close to the Super Bowl last year, expectations were high for the team in 2017. Unfortunately, things have not gone as planned. The Broncos have struggled to find consistency all season long, and they are currently sitting at 6-7 on the year.

There has been plenty of speculation about whether or not head coach Vance Joseph will be fired at the end of the season. While nothing has been officially announced yet, it does seem like a possibility. If Joseph is fired, there is no clear front runner for the job. However, one name that has been mentioned is former Broncos quarterback John Elway.

Elway is currently serving as the general manager for the team, but there is no doubt that he would be interested in becoming head coach. He has a lot of experience as a player and he knows what it takes to win in Denver. There is no guarantee that he would be successful as a head coach, but he would certainly be a popular choice among fans and players alike.

At this point, it’s unclear what is going to happen with the Broncos coaching staff. However, one thing seems certain: there will be some big changes ahead.

# Do you think Johannes?

I don't know, Johannes. 

I've been thinking about this a lot and I just don't know what to think. 

You're always so sure of yourself and your opinions, but this issue is just so complex. 

On one hand, it seems like the obvious thing to do - we've been talking about it for years and the time is right. 
But on the other hand, I'm just not sure if we're ready for it. 

What if it fails? What if we can't make it work? We'd be risking everything we've built up over the years. 

And yet, at the same time, I can't help but feel like we're missing out on something if we don't take this step. 

It's a tough decision, Johannes, that's for sure.

# What do you think of this event?

I think it was really great! The things that were going on were so interesting and I liked the way it was set up.

Judgment day has come for Android phone users. Google has announced that new phones running its latest operating system, Android P, will not have the traditional home button and on-screen navigation bar.

This change means that if you have an older Android phone, you might not be able to upgrade it to the new OS. Users of these devices have taken to social media to express their disappointment with the company.

One Twitter user said, “What is this world we’re living in where I can’t even update my perfectly good phone to the latest software because Google doesn’t want me to?”

Another said, “I don’t care how trendy it is, I don’t want a phone without a home button!”

It’s clear that many people are unhappy with this change. But why did Google make it?

Well, first of all, it should be noted that not everyone will be affected by this change. If you have a newer Android phone, such as the Pixel 2 or Galaxy S9, you will be able to upgrade to Android P without any problems.

But for those with older devices, there are a few reasons why Google might have made this decision. For one thing, on-screen buttons use up valuable screen space. By getting rid of them, Google can make more room for other elements on the display.

Additionally, removing the home button makes it easier for manufacturers to create phones with different screen sizes and shapes. This is important given that many different types of phones are now being released – such as foldable phones – and each one needs its own specific set of navigation buttons.

So while some people may be unhappy about this change, there are legitimate reasons why Google decided to make it. And ultimately, it will be up to each individual user to decide whether they want to upgrade their device or not.
