are the 8 best places to buy overseas property","date":"2022-08-15T12:16:15.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are the 8 best places to buy overseas property?\n\nWhen it comes to finding the best places to buy overseas property, there are a few things that you’ll want to take into account. For example, what kind of climate do you want? What’s the cost of living like in the area? And how easy is it to get around?\n\nHere are eight great places to consider when buying property overseas:\n\n1. Portugal\n\nPortugal is a great place to buy overseas property thanks to its temperate climate and affordable cost of living. It’s also a very walkable country, making it easy to get around without needing a car.\n\n2. Italy\n\nItaly is another popular destination for overseas property buyers, thanks to its stunning coastal towns and delicious food. It can be a bit more expensive than Portugal, but it’s still much more affordable than buying property in countries like France or Spain.\n\n3. Greece\n\nGreece is a great place for those looking for a sunny beach vacation home. The cost of living is relatively low, and you can find some beautiful properties on the coastlines. Just be aware that availability can be limited due to the country’s popularity as a tourist destination.\n\n4. Spain\n\nSpain is another great option for those looking for a sunny European beachfront home. It’s one of the most affordable countries in Europe, and there are plenty of towns and villages to choose from. Just beware that getting around can be difficult if you don’t know Spanish!\n\n5. Thailand\n\nIf you’re looking for an exotic overseas property destination, Thailand should definitely be on your list. The cost of living is low, the weather is hot and sunny all year round, and you can find some beautiful properties on the beachfront or in lush tropical settings. Just be aware that Thailand can be quite different from other Western countries, so it may take some getting used to.\n\n6. Cambodia\n\nCambodia is another up-and-coming destination for overseas property buyers. It offers beautiful beaches, lush jungles, and plenty of cultural experiences – all at a fraction of the price you would pay in neighbouring Thailand or Vietnam. Foreigners can own land in Cambodia without any restrictions, making it an ideal choice for those looking for investment properties as well as holiday homes.\n\n#  What is the criteria for choosing these 8 locations?\n\nSome people might be wondering what the criteria is for choosing the 8 locations that are going to be receiving Amazon’s new headquarters.  While there is no certain answer, there are a few things that could be taken into account.  The following are just a few of the factors that could be considered when choosing a city for Amazon’s new headquarters:\n\n1.  How business-friendly is the city?\n\nThis could include things like how easy it is to get permits and how low the taxes are.  Amazon is looking to make a big impact with this new headquarters, so they will likely want a city that is welcoming to businesses.\n\n2.  What kind of infrastructure does the city have?\n\nAmazon will need things like good roads, bridges, and airports if they are going to consider a city.  They will also need plenty of space for their new headquarters, which means that cities with high population densities might not be as appealing.\n\n3. What kind of workforce does the city have?\n\n Amazon is looking for a city with a large pool of talented workers that they can hire from.  This includes things like local universities and colleges with strong engineering programs.\n\n#  How do you determine if an area is a good place to invest in property?\n\nWhen considering investing in property, one of the key things you need to take into account is the potential for capital growth. By doing your research and assessing certain areas, you can determine whether or not they are good places to invest in property.\n\nHere are some factors to look at when assessing an area for investment:\n\n1. Population growth\n\nOne of the most important factors to consider when looking at potential property investment is population growth. If an area is experiencing consistent population growth, it’s likely that demand for property will be high and prices will continue to increase. Conversely, if an area is experiencing population decline, it may be a sign that the market is saturated and prices are likely to drop in the future.\n\n2. Employment opportunities\n\nAnother important factor to look at when assessing an area for investment is employment opportunities. If the area has a strong economy with lots of job opportunities, it’s likely that demand for housing will be high. This means that you can expect prices to stay relatively stable or increase over time. On the other hand, if the area has a weak economy with few job opportunities, demand for housing may be low and prices could potentially decrease in the future.\n\n3. Infrastructure development\n\nIf an area is seeing a lot of infrastructure development, it can be a good sign for potential property investors. This is because infrastructure development typically leads to increased job opportunities and population growth – both of which are good indicators for capital growth. However, it’s important to do your research and make sure that the infrastructure development is actually happening (rather than being planned) and that it will benefit the area as a whole rather than just a small number of people.\n\n4. Schools and amenities\n\nIt’s also important to consider schools and amenities when assessing an area for investment. Areas with good schools and plenty of amenities tend to be more desirable, which means that demand for housing is usually higher and prices are usually higher too. Therefore, if you’re looking for long-term capital growth, investing in areas like this may be a wise decision.\n\n#  Are there any risks associated with buying overseas property?\n\nThere can be a lot of risks associated with buying overseas property, but with proper due diligence, these risks can be mitigated. Some of the key risks include:\n\n- Currency risk: If the local currency weakens against your home currency, you may lose money on your investment.\n- Political and economic risk: The country's political and economic stability can affect your investment. For example, if the country experiences a political or economic crisis, you may not be able to sell your property or you may have to sell it at a loss.\n- Regulatory risk: The country's regulations governing foreign ownership of property can change suddenly, negatively affecting your investment.\n- Legal risk: The legal system in the country where the property is located may be unfamiliar to you and there is a greater chance of being scammed or dealing with corrupt officials.\n- Tax risk: You may be liable for taxes in the country where the property is located that you were not expecting, such as wealth or estate taxes.\n\nWhile there are definitely some risks associated with buying overseas property, if you do your homework and take steps to mitigate them, it can be a very lucrative investment.\n\n#  How do you calculate potential returns on investment from overseas property?\n\n## Introduction\n\nDetermining the potential returns on investment from an overseas property can be difficult. There are a number of factors to consider, including the purchase price, the cost of maintaining and renting out the property, and any taxes or other fees that may apply. This guide will help you calculate your potential returns and make an informed decision about whether investing in an overseas property is right for you.\n\n## The maths\n\nThere are three key steps in calculating potential returns on investment from an overseas property:\n\n1) Determining the purchase price and associated costs\n2) Estimating rental income and expenses\n3) Calculating returns on investment\n\nEach step is explained in more detail below.\n\n### 1) Determining the purchase price and associated costs\nThe first step is to work out how much you will need to invest in order to buy the property. You will also need to factor in any associated costs, such as legal fees, stamp duty, and agent's fees. To get a rough idea of these costs, you can use online calculators or contact a local real estate agent.\n\nIt's important to remember that exchange rates can fluctuate significantly, so it's important to do your research and wait until the exchange rate is favourable before making your purchase. Additionally, some countries have higher purchase prices than others – so it's important to do your research into the average house prices in the area you're interested in.\n\n### 2) Estimating rental income and expenses  Once you have purchased your property, it's important to estimate how much rent you can expect to receive each month, as well as any associated expenses.

For example, what kind of climate do you want? What’s the cost of living like in the area? And how easy is it to get around?\n\nHere are eight great places to consider when buying property overseas:\n\n1. Portugal\n\nPortugal is a great place to buy overseas property thanks to its temperate climate and affordable cost of living. It’s also a very walkable country, making it easy to get around without needing a car.\n\n2. Italy\n\nItaly is another popular destination for overseas property buyers, thanks to its stunning coastal towns and delicious food. It can be a bit more expensive than Portugal, but it’s still much more affordable than buying property in countries like France or Spain.\n\n3. Greece\n\nGreece is a great place for those looking for a sunny beach vacation home. The cost of living is relatively low, and you can find some beautiful properties on the coastlines. Just be aware that availability can be limited due to the country’s popularity as a tourist destination.\n\n4. Spain\n\nSpain is another great option for those looking for a sunny European beachfront home. It’s one of the most affordable countries in Europe, and there are plenty of towns and villages to choose from. Just beware that getting around can be difficult if you don’t know Spanish!\n\n5. Thailand\n\nIf you’re looking for an exotic overseas property destination, Thailand should definitely be on your list. The cost of living is low, the weather is hot and sunny all year round, and you can find some beautiful properties on the beachfront or in lush tropical settings. Just be aware that Thailand can be quite different from other Western countries, so it may take some getting used to.\n\n6. Cambodia\n\nCambodia is another up-and-coming destination for overseas property buyers. It offers beautiful beaches, lush jungles, and plenty of cultural experiences – all at a fraction of the price you would pay in neighbouring Thailand or Vietnam. Foreigners can own land in Cambodia without any restrictions, making it an ideal choice for those looking for investment properties as well as holiday homes.\n\n#  What is the criteria for choosing these 8 locations?\n\nSome people might be wondering what the criteria is for choosing the 8 locations that are going to be receiving Amazon’s new headquarters.  While there is no certain answer, there are a few things that could be taken into account.  The following are just a few of the factors that could be considered when choosing a city for Amazon’s new headquarters:\n\n1.  How business-friendly is the city?\n\nThis could include things like how easy it is to get permits and how low the taxes are.  Amazon is looking to make a big impact with this new headquarters, so they will likely want a city that is welcoming to businesses.\n\n2.  What kind of infrastructure does the city have?\n\nAmazon will need things like good roads, bridges, and airports if they are going to consider a city.  They will also need plenty of space for their new headquarters, which means that cities with high population densities might not be as appealing.\n\n3. What kind of workforce does the city have?\n\n Amazon is looking for a city with a large pool of talented workers that they can hire from.  This includes things like local universities and colleges with strong engineering programs.\n\n#  How do you determine if an area is a good place to invest in property?\n\nWhen considering investing in property, one of the key things you need to take into account is the potential for capital growth. By doing your research and assessing certain areas, you can determine whether or not they are good places to invest in property.\n\nHere are some factors to look at when assessing an area for investment:\n\n1. Population growth\n\nOne of the most important factors to consider when looking at potential property investment is population growth. If an area is experiencing consistent population growth, it’s likely that demand for property will be high and prices will continue to increase. Conversely, if an area is experiencing population decline, it may be a sign that the market is saturated and prices are likely to drop in the future.\n\n2. Employment opportunities\n\nAnother important factor to look at when assessing an area for investment is employment opportunities. If the area has a strong economy with lots of job opportunities, it’s likely that demand for housing will be high. This means that you can expect prices to stay relatively stable or increase over time. On the other hand, if the area has a weak economy with few job opportunities, demand for housing may be low and prices could potentially decrease in the future.\n\n3. Infrastructure development\n\nIf an area is seeing a lot of infrastructure development, it can be a good sign for potential property investors. This is because infrastructure development typically leads to increased job opportunities and population growth – both of which are good indicators for capital growth. However, it’s important to do your research and make sure that the infrastructure development is actually happening (rather than being planned) and that it will benefit the area as a whole rather than just a small number of people.\n\n4. Schools and amenities\n\nIt’s also important to consider schools and amenities when assessing an area for investment. Areas with good schools and plenty of amenities tend to be more desirable, which means that demand for housing is usually higher and prices are usually higher too. Therefore, if you’re looking for long-term capital growth, investing in areas like this may be a wise decision.\n\n#  Are there any risks associated with buying overseas property?\n\nThere can be a lot of risks associated with buying overseas property, but with proper due diligence, these risks can be mitigated. Some of the key risks include:\n\n- Currency risk: If the local currency weakens against your home currency, you may lose money on your investment.\n- Political and economic risk: The country's political and economic stability can affect your investment. For example, if the country experiences a political or economic crisis, you may not be able to sell your property or you may have to sell it at a loss.\n- Regulatory risk: The country's regulations governing foreign ownership of property can change suddenly, negatively affecting your investment.\n- Legal risk: The legal system in the country where the property is located may be unfamiliar to you and there is a greater chance of being scammed or dealing with corrupt officials.\n- Tax risk: You may be liable for taxes in the country where the property is located that you were not expecting, such as wealth or estate taxes.\n\nWhile there are definitely some risks associated with buying overseas property, if you do your homework and take steps to mitigate them, it can be a very lucrative investment.\n\n#  How do you calculate potential returns on investment from overseas property?\n\n## Introduction\n\nDetermining the potential returns on investment from an overseas property can be difficult. There are a number of factors to consider, including the purchase price, the cost of maintaining and renting out the property, and any taxes or other fees that may apply. This guide will help you calculate your potential returns and make an informed decision about whether investing in an overseas property is right for you.\n\n## The maths\n\nThere are three key steps in calculating potential returns on investment from an overseas property:\n\n1) Determining the purchase price and associated costs\n2) Estimating rental income and expenses\n3) Calculating returns on investment\n\nEach step is explained in more detail below.\n\n### 1) Determining the purchase price and associated costs\nThe first step is to work out how much you will need to invest in order to buy the property. You will also need to factor in any associated costs, such as legal fees, stamp duty, and agent's fees. To get a rough idea of these costs, you can use online calculators or contact a local real estate agent.\n\nIt's important to remember that exchange rates can fluctuate significantly, so it's important to do your research and wait until the exchange rate is favourable before making your purchase. Additionally, some countries have higher purchase prices than others – so it's important to do your research into the average house prices in the area you're interested in.\n\n### 2) Estimating rental income and expenses  Once you have purchased your property, it's important to estimate how much rent you can expect to receive each month, as well as any associated expenses. These include:    Repairs and maintenance – depending on how well the property has been maintained, you may need to set aside money for repairs and maintenance each month Advertising and agents fees – most landlords will need to pay for advertising their properties, as well as agents' fees (if using a management company) Utilities – tenants usually pay for their own utilities, but you should budget for bills such as water, gas, and electricity Property taxes – many countries charge a property tax which landlords must pay Other costs – this could include anything from home insurance to ground rent\n\n\n\n To estimate your rental income each month:    Multiply the monthly rent by 12 Divide this figure by the average number of days per year that the property is rented out (usually around 260) This gives you your annual rental income\n\n  To estimate your expenses each month:    Add up all of your estimated monthly expenses Subtract this figure from your annual rental income This gives you your net monthly rental income\n\n\n\n So far we have calculated our potential returns on investment as follows: Annual rental income: $12000  Rent received per month: $1000 Monthly expenses: -$600 Net monthly rental income: $400 Return on investment (ROI): 33%\n\n However, there are other factors to consider when estimating returns on investment from an overseas property. ### 3) Calculating returns on investment Finally, we need to calculate our ROI. To do this we need two figures: The amount of money we've invested (the purchase price plus associated costs) The amount of money we've made back (annual rental income minus total monthly expenses) This calculation gives us our ROI percentage: ROI = ((Amount of money we've made back)/(Amount of money we've invested))*100 In our example above: ($12000/$20000)*100 = 66% As you can see, our estimated return on investment from this overseas property is 66%. While this figure may change depending on individual circumstances, it provides a good indication of what sort of profits could be made from such an investment.","slug":"What-are-the-8-best-places-to-buy-overseas-property","published":1,"updated":"2022-08-15T12:16:15.096Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl6upzm680001xsv5dw8q6spe","content":"<h1 id=\"What-are-the-8-best-places-to-buy-overseas-property\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-8-best-places-to-buy-overseas-property\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the 8 best places to buy overseas property?\"></a>What are the 8 best places to buy overseas property?</h1><p>When it comes to finding the best places to buy overseas property, there are a few things that you’ll want to take into account.

By doing your research and assessing certain areas, you can determine whether or not they are good places to invest in property.</p>\n<p>Here are some factors to look at when assessing an area for investment:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Population growth</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the most important factors to consider when looking at potential property investment is population growth. If an area is experiencing consistent population growth, it’s likely that demand for property will be high and prices will continue to increase. Conversely, if an area is experiencing population decline, it may be a sign that the market is saturated and prices are likely to drop in the future.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Employment opportunities</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another important factor to look at when assessing an area for investment is employment opportunities. If the area has a strong economy with lots of job opportunities, it’s likely that demand for housing will be high. This means that you can expect prices to stay relatively stable or increase over time. On the other hand, if the area has a weak economy with few job opportunities, demand for housing may be low and prices could potentially decrease in the future.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Infrastructure development</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If an area is seeing a lot of infrastructure development, it can be a good sign for potential property investors. This is because infrastructure development typically leads to increased job opportunities and population growth – both of which are good indicators for capital growth. However, it’s important to do your research and make sure that the infrastructure development is actually happening (rather than being planned) and that it will benefit the area as a whole rather than just a small number of people.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Schools and amenities</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s also important to consider schools and amenities when assessing an area for investment. Areas with good schools and plenty of amenities tend to be more desirable, which means that demand for housing is usually higher and prices are usually higher too. Therefore, if you’re looking for long-term capital growth, investing in areas like this may be a wise decision.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Are-there-any-risks-associated-with-buying-overseas-property\"><a href=\"#Are-there-any-risks-associated-with-buying-overseas-property\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Are there any risks associated with buying overseas property?\"></a>Are there any risks associated with buying overseas property?</h1><p>There can be a lot of risks associated with buying overseas property, but with proper due diligence, these risks can be mitigated.

You will also need to factor in any associated costs, such as legal fees, stamp duty, and agent’s fees. To get a rough idea of these costs, you can use online calculators or contact a local real estate agent.</p>\n<p>It’s important to remember that exchange rates can fluctuate significantly, so it’s important to do your research and wait until the exchange rate is favourable before making your purchase.

Consider Your Investment Strategy\n\nAnother key factor to consider when owning an overseas property is your investment strategy. Are you looking for a short-term rental income? A long-term rental income? Or maybe capital growth is your main priority? By understanding what you’re hoping to achieve with your investment, you can tailor your search for an overseas property accordingly. And if you’re not sure where to start, consult with a professional advisor who can help you develop a strategy that meets your goals.\n\n3.

Some of the benefits of owning an overseas property include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Investment: Property is a great investment, and buying property overseas can be a particularly wise decision as it often tends to increase in value more rapidly than domestic properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Vacation Home: Owning a second home that you can escape to for vacation can be a great way to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Tax Benefits: When you own property in another country, you may be able to take advantage of certain tax benefits, such as being able to deduct certain expenses from your taxable income.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stability: Depending on the location of your overseas property, it can offer a much more stable environment in which to invest your money and/or live than the domestic market.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Education: Another benefit of owning an overseas property is that it can provide a great place for your children to study abroad if they are interested in learning another language or experiencing a new culture.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"How-can-you-maximize-the-benefits-of-owning-an-overseas-property\"><a href=\"#How-can-you-maximize-the-benefits-of-owning-an-overseas-property\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How can you maximize the benefits of owning an overseas property?\"></a>How can you maximize the benefits of owning an overseas property?</h1><p>The benefits of owning an overseas property are vast, and for those looking to get the most out of their purchase, it’s important to understand how you can maximize these benefits. From tax breaks to accessing new markets, here are four tips on how to get the most from your overseas property investment.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Research Your Tax Situation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When it comes to owning an overseas property, one of the key considerations is your tax situation. Depending on your country of residence and that of the overseas property, you may be able to take advantage of certain tax breaks. For example, in the UK there are a range of tax breaks available for those who own a second home or investment property abroad. So, be sure to do your research and understand what tax benefits may be available to you.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Consider Your Investment Strategy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another key factor to consider when owning an overseas property is your investment strategy. Are you looking for a short-term rental income? A long-term rental income? Or maybe capital growth is your main priority? By understanding what you’re hoping to achieve with your investment, you can tailor your search for an overseas property accordingly. And if you’re not sure where to start, consult with a professional advisor who can help you develop a strategy that meets your goals.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Take Advantage of Easy Accessibility</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the great advantages of owning an overseas property is the ease of accessibility. Thanks to modern technology, it’s now easier than ever before to keep on top of your investment no matter where in the world it is located. Whether you’re using online banking tools and software or simply keeping track of activity through photos and updates sent by family and friends, there are plenty of ways to stay connected with your investment even when you’re not physically there.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Use It as a Holiday Home</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lastly, another great way to get the most out of your overseas property is by using it as a holiday home. Not only will this give you the chance to enjoy all that your destination has to offer, but it can also be a great source of income if you rent it out during peak holiday seasons. So, if you’re looking for an excuse to take regular holidays abroad – and make some money while you’re at it – then owning an overseas property could be the perfect solution for you!</p>\n<h1 id=\"Are-there-any-potential-risks-associated-with-owning-an-overseas-property\"><a href=\"#Are-there-any-potential-risks-associated-with-owning-an-overseas-property\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Are there any potential risks associated with owning an overseas property?\"></a>Are there any potential risks associated with owning an overseas property?</h1><p>There are a few potential risks associated with owning an overseas property. One of the main risks is that there may be legal issues with the property that you are not aware of until it is too late. It is important to do your research and to have a good understanding of the local laws before purchasing a property.</p>\n<p>Another risk associated with owning an overseas property is that it may be difficult to maintain or manage from a distance. If you are not able to visit the property regularly, it may be tough to keep on top of things like repairs and maintenance.</p>\n<p>Finally, another risk associated with owning an overseas property is that you may not be able to sell it easily or at all if the market in that area declines. It is important to consider whether you will be able to sell the property if you need to and what implications this could have for you financially.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-are-the-best-ways-to-manage-your-property-investment-portfolio\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-best-ways-to-manage-your-property-investment-portfolio\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the best ways to manage your property investment portfolio?\"></a>What are the best ways to manage your property investment portfolio?</h1><p>When it comes to managing your property investment portfolio, there are a few key things you need to keep in mind.

They offer a wide variety of games, as well as some of the best bonuses and promotions in the business. But do they offer good enough odds to make it worth your while?\n\nBefore answering that question, let's take a look at some of the things you can expect from 888:\n\n-A massive game selection, including slots, table games, and live casino games\n-A generous bonus structure, with up to £888 available for new players\n-Daily promotions and tournaments\n-Fast and easy payouts\n\nSo how do the odds compare? In general, online casinos offer worse odds than traditional land-based casinos. But this isn't always the case, and 888 is one of those casinos that offers fairly good odds. In fact, their blackjack games offer some of the best odds in the business. So if blackjack is your game, 888 is definitely worth checking out.\n\nOverall, 888 is a great choice for UK players. They offer excellent games and bonuses, as well as smooth and reliable gameplay. So if you're looking for a quality online casino experience, 888 is hard to beat.\n\n# Do you think Denver Broncos?\n\nIt’s been a tough year for the Denver Broncos. After coming so close to the Super Bowl last year, expectations were high for the team in 2017. Unfortunately, things have not gone as planned. The Broncos have struggled to find consistency all season long, and they are currently sitting at 6-7 on the year.\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation about whether or not head coach Vance Joseph will be fired at the end of the season. While nothing has been officially announced yet, it does seem like a possibility. If Joseph is fired, there is no clear front runner for the job. However, one name that has been mentioned is former Broncos quarterback John Elway.\n\nElway is currently serving as the general manager for the team, but there is no doubt that he would be interested in becoming head coach. He has a lot of experience as a player and he knows what it takes to win in Denver. There is no guarantee that he would be successful as a head coach, but he would certainly be a popular choice among fans and players alike.\n\nAt this point, it’s unclear what is going to happen with the Broncos coaching staff. However, one thing seems certain: there will be some big changes ahead.\n\n# Do you think Johannes?\n\nI don't know, Johannes. \n\nI've been thinking about this a lot and I just don't know what to think. \n\nYou're always so sure of yourself and your opinions, but this issue is just so complex. \n\nOn one hand, it seems like the obvious thing to do - we've been talking about it for years and the time is right. \nBut on the other hand, I'm just not sure if we're ready for it. \n\nWhat if it fails? What if we can't make it work? We'd be risking everything we've built up over the years. \n\nAnd yet, at the same time, I can't help but feel like we're missing out on something if we don't take this step. \n\nIt's a tough decision, Johannes, that's for sure.\n\n# What do you think of this event?\n\nI think it was really great! The things that were going on were so interesting and I liked the way it was set up.\n\n# How do you feel about it?\n\nJudgment day has come for Android phone users. Google has announced that new phones running its latest operating system, Android P, will not have the traditional home button and on-screen navigation bar.\n\nThis change means that if you have an older Android phone, you might not be able to upgrade it to the new OS. Users of these devices have taken to social media to express their disappointment with the company.\n\nOne Twitter user said, “What is this world we’re living in where I can’t even update my perfectly good phone to the latest software because Google doesn’t want me to?”\n\nAnother said, “I don’t care how trendy it is, I don’t want a phone without a home button!”\n\nIt’s clear that many people are unhappy with this change. But why did Google make it?\n\nWell, first of all, it should be noted that not everyone will be affected by this change. If you have a newer Android phone, such as the Pixel 2 or Galaxy S9, you will be able to upgrade to Android P without any problems.\n\nBut for those with older devices, there are a few reasons why Google might have made this decision. For one thing, on-screen buttons use up valuable screen space. By getting rid of them, Google can make more room for other elements on the display.\n\nAdditionally, removing the home button makes it easier for manufacturers to create phones with different screen sizes and shapes. This is important given that many different types of phones are now being released – such as foldable phones – and each one needs its own specific set of navigation buttons.\n\nSo while some people may be unhappy about this change, there are legitimate reasons why Google decided to make it.

Users of these devices have taken to social media to express their disappointment with the company.</p>\n<p>One Twitter user said, “What is this world we’re living in where I can’t even update my perfectly good phone to the latest software because Google doesn’t want me to?”</p>\n<p>Another said, “I don’t care how trendy it is, I don’t want a phone without a home button!”</p>\n<p>It’s clear that many people are unhappy with this change. But why did Google make it?</p>\n<p>Well, first of all, it should be noted that not everyone will be affected by this change. If you have a newer Android phone, such as the Pixel 2 or Galaxy S9, you will be able to upgrade to Android P without any problems.</p>\n<p>But for those with older devices, there are a few reasons why Google might have made this decision. For one thing, on-screen buttons use up valuable screen space. By getting rid of them, Google can make more room for other elements on the display.</p>\n<p>Additionally, removing the home button makes it easier for manufacturers to create phones with different screen sizes and shapes. This is important given that many different types of phones are now being released – such as foldable phones – and each one needs its own specific set of navigation buttons.</p>\n<p>So while some people may be unhappy about this change, there are legitimate reasons why Google decided to make it. And ultimately, it will be up to each individual user to decide whether they want to upgrade their device or not.</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[{"post_id":"cl6upzm680001xsv5dw8q6spe","category_id":"cl6upzm6c0003xsv52hny9mjh","_id":"cl6upzm6e0004xsv52ob60pb9"},{"post_id":"cl85t6f650000psv58nw6ecik","category_id":"cl6upzm6c0003xsv52hny9mjh","_id":"cl85t6f6a0001psv5750egosf"},{"post_id":"cl8czg2uv0000e4v58dhi0m00","category_id":"cl8czg2v00001e4v5117q8aba","_id":"cl8czg2v20002e4v5fhf616nr"}],"PostTag":[],"Tag":[]}}
